This is the first of two parallelization labs. It will take you
through some basic steps to parallelize your code using
**[Futureverse]**. It focuses on core functions `future()` and
`value()` for the purpose of illustrating what happens behind the
scenes when we parallelize R code.

You are highly encouraged to test things out yourself and tweak things
to figure out how these methods behave.

## Install

We will start out by installing common Futureverse packages part of
the Futureverse. We will not need them all in this lab, but it is
convenient to have them all installed already now.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("futureverse")
```


## Exercises

In order to illustrate parallelization, we need two things: (i) a way
to measure time, and (ii) something that takes at least a few seconds
to run.

**Task `{r} task()`:**

Copy and paste the following two code blocks.

Create functions `tic()` and `toc()` to measure time:

```{r}
#| eval: false
tic <- function() {
  tic_start <<- base::Sys.time()
}

toc <- function() {
  dt <- base::difftime(base::Sys.time(), tic_start)
  dt <- round(dt, digits = 1L)
  message(paste(format(dt), "since tic()"))
}
```

These functions can be used as a timer, e.g.

```{r}
#| eval: false
tic()
Sys.sleep(1.5)
toc()
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
cat("1.5 secs since tic()\n")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
Sys.sleep(4.0)
toc()
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
cat("5.5 secs since tic()\n")
```


Next, create toy function `slow_sum()` for calculating the sum of a
vector really slowly:

```{r}
#| eval: false
slow_sum <- function(x) {
  sum <- 0
  for (value in x) {
    Sys.sleep(1.0)     ## one-second slowdown per value
    sum <- sum + value
  }
  sum
}
```

This function works just like `sum()`, but it is very slow. If we use
it to calculate $1 + 2 + \ldots + 10$, it will takes us ten seconds to
get the result;

```{r}
#| eval: false
tic()
y <- slow_sum(1:10)
y
toc()
```

_Make sure you can run the latter, that it takes ten seconds to
complete and that it returns the correct value._

We are now ready to get rolling!


### Simple parallel tasks

At the very core of Futureverse is the **[future]** package. Let us
start out by loading this core package:

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(future)
```

It provides us with the fundamental building blocks for running R code
in parallel; functions `future()`, `value()`, and `resolved()`.  Other
Futureverse packages, such as **future.apply**, **furrr**, and
**doFuture**, rely on these three functions to build up more
feature-rich functions. We will return to those later, but for now we
will focus on `future()` and `value()`.


**Task `{r} task()`:**

Let's start by writing our initial example using futures:

```{r}
#| eval: false
tic()
f <- future(slow_sum(1:10))
y <- value(f)
toc()
```

_Confirm that you get the correct result. Did it run faster?_

<!-- No, because the default is plan(sequential) -->


**Task `{r} task()`:**

Add another `toc()` just after the `future()` call;

```{r}
#| eval: false
tic()
f <- future(slow_sum(1:10))
toc()
y <- value(f)
toc()
y
toc()
```

_How long did the creation of the future take?_

<!-- It took a long time, because `future()` is blocking with
plan(sequential) -->


**Task `{r} task()`:**

By design, Futureverse runs everything sequentially by default. We can
configure it run code in parallel using two background workers as:

```{r}
#| eval: false
plan(multisession, workers = 2)
```

_Make this change, and rerun the above example. Did the different
steps take as long as you expected? What do you think the reason is
for the change?_

<!-- The `future()` call is swift, because it is non-blocking when
using a parallel backend. The total processing time, however, is still
the same, because `future()` is evaluating the expression in
a single parallel worker. -->


**Task `{r} task()`:**

Let's calculate $1 + 2 + \ldots + 10$ in two steps: (a) $1 + 2 +
\ldots + 5$ and (b) $6 + 7 + \ldots + 10$, and then sum the two
results.

```{r}
#| eval: false
fa <- future(slow_sum(1:5))
fb <- future(slow_sum(6:10))
y <- value(fa) + value(fb)
y
```

But first, make sure to add `toc()` after each statement to better
understand how long each step takes;

```{r}
#| eval: false
tic()
fa <- future(slow_sum(1:5))
toc()
fb <- future(slow_sum(6:10))
toc()
y <- value(fa) + value(fb)
toc()
y
toc()
```

_Make sure you get the expected result. Did it finish sooner? Which
step takes the longest? Why do you think that is?_

<!-- Both `future()` calls are swift, because they are non-blocking
when using a parallel backend. However, `y <- value(fa) + value(fb)`
blocks, because it waits for the values of future `fa` and future `fb`
to be available. The total processing time is five seconds. -->


### Create many parallel tasks via a for loop

**Task `{r} task()`:**

Here is a very complicated way of calculating the sum $1 + 2 + \ldots
+ 20$ in four chunks and outputting messages to show the progress:

```{r}
#| eval: false
tic()
xs <- list(1:5, 6:10, 11:15, 16:20)
ys <- list()
for (ii in seq_along(xs)) {
  message(paste0("Iteration ", ii))
  ys[[ii]] <- slow_sum(xs[[ii]])
}
message("Done")
print(ys)

ys <- unlist(ys)
ys

y <- sum(ys)
y
toc()
```

Rewrite it such that each iteration is parallelized via a future. Use
four parallel workers as in:

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(future)
plan(multisession, workers = 4)
```

<!--

library(future)
plan(multisession, workers = 4)

tic()

xs <- list(1:5, 6:10, 11:15, 16:20)

fs <- list()
for (ii in seq_along(xs)) {
  message(paste0("Iteration ", ii))
  fs[[ii]] <- future( slow_sum(xs[[ii]]) )
}
message("Done")

ys <- value(fs)
ys <- unlist(ys)
ys               ## [1] 15 40 65 90
y <- sum(ys)
y                ## 210

toc()
-->


**Task `{r} task()`:**

Retry with three parallel workers as in:

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(future)
plan(multisession, workers = 3)
```

_Did you notice something?  What do you think happened?_


### Errors and parallel processing

The Futureverse has been designed such that your experience running
parallel code will be as close as possible to when you run regular,
sequential code. For example, if we call:

```{r, error = TRUE}
x <- "1.2"
y <- log(x)
```

we get an error.

**Task `{r} task()`:**

If we try the same with a future, it's natural to expect the same error;

```{r, error = TRUE}
#| eval: false
f <- future(log(x))
```

_Run the above. Did you get an error or not? What could be the reason
for that?_

<!-- We will not get an error until we collect the results, which only
happens when we try to get the value of `f`. -->

_If we try to get the value of `f` as in_


```{r, error = TRUE}
#| eval: false
y <- value(f)
```

_what happens?_

<!-- Here we are requesting the value of `f`, which will trigger the
error to be signalled. -->


::: {.callout-note}

At first, it might appear obvious that we should get an error in these
cases and that it will look the same as when running regular
sequential code. But rest assured, Futureverse is the only parallel
framework that behave this way. If you use one of the traditional
frameworks you will get a different type of error, or not an error at
all. This is the case for `parLapply()` and `mclapply()` of
**parallel** as well as for `foreach()` and `%dopar%` of **foreach**.

:::


**Task `{r} task()`:**

Try with the following sequential code:

```{r, error = TRUE}
#| eval: false
y <- lapply(list("1.2", 42), log)
```

_Did you get an error?_

Next, try the same but with `mclapply()` of the **parallel** package;

```{r, error = TRUE}
#| eval: false
library(parallel)
y <- mclapply(list("1.2", 42), log)
```

_What happened - did you get an error?_

_What do you get if you look at `y`, e.g. `print(y)` or `str(y)`?_



**Task `{r} task()`:**

Let's continue with our future-based example. What do you think the
behavior is if we switch back to sequential processing using:

```{r, error = TRUE}
#| eval: false
plan(sequential)

f <- future(log(x))
y <- value(f)
```

? Try it. _What do you observe? Did you expect something different?
Did the error happen already when calling `future()` or when calling
`value()`?_

When done, make sure to switch back to parallel processing again:

```{r}
#| eval: false
plan(multisession, workers = 2)
```


### Warnings and parallel processing

Just like errors, warnings are signalled as-is when parallelizing via
futures.

**Task `{r} task()`:**

Try the following:

```{r}
#| eval: false
x <- c(1.2, -0.5)
f <- future(log(x))
y <- value(f)
y
```

_Did you get a warning? By the way, how do you think the parallel
worker that runs in the background and evalutes `log(x)` knows what
the value of `x` is?_
